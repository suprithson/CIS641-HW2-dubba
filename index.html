        <h2>Why shopping website </h2>
        <p>
          My interest to develop an online shopping platform emerged two semesters ago when I entered courses such as Graphical User Interface. This is exactly what I am passionate about, and I am keen on sharpening my skills in programming languages and learning of the latest technologies. The Shopping Website is not just an ecommerce. It is an immersive and wonderful shopping experience. Users can go through numerous product categories and access comprehensive product details and add desired items into their carts without facing any problems. This project presents a golden opportunity for me to demonstrate my competency in web development, put my knowledge into application, and further enhance my understanding. With this project, I am committed to using it to demonstrate my skills and enhance my skills and experience.</p>
